# Clean up and next steps of managed identity tutorial

This article is part of a tutorial about deploying a Python app to Azure App Service. The web app uses managed identity to authenticate to other Azure resources. In this article, you'll clean up resources used in Azure so you don't incur other charges and help keep your Azure subscription uncluttered. You can leave the Azure resources running if you want to use them for further development work. 

## 1. Clean up resources

In this tutorial, all the Azure resources were created in the same resource group. Removing the resource group removes all resources in the resource group and is the fastest way to remove all Azure resources used for your app.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and follow these steps to delete a resource group.

### [VS Code](#tab/vscode-aztools)

To work with Azure resources in VS Code, you must have the [Azure Tools extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) installed and be signed into Azure from VS Code.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Azure CLI commands can be run in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) or on a workstation with the [Azure CLI installed](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## 2. Next steps 

After completing this tutorial, here are some next steps you can take to build upon what you learned and move the tutorial code and deployment closer to production ready:

* Secure communication to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, see [Use Virtual Network service endpoints and rules for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server](/azure/postgresql/single-server/concepts-data-access-and-security-vnet).

* Map a custom DNS name to your app, see [Tutorial: Map custom DNS name to your app](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain).

* Monitor App Service for availability, performance, and operation, see [Monitoring App Service](/azure/app-service/monitor-app-service) and [Set up Azure Monitor for your Python application](/azure/azure-monitor/app/opencensus-python).

* Enable continuous deployment to Azure App Service, see [Continuous deployment to Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment), [Use CI/CD to deploy a Python web app to Azure App Service on Linux](/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp), and [Design a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/apps/devops-dotnet-webapp).

* More details on how App Service runs a Python app, see [Configure Python app](/azure/app-service/configure-language-python).

* Review PostgresSQL best practices, see [Best practices for building an application with Azure Database for PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/single-server/application-best-practices).

* Learn more about security for Blob storage, see [Security recommendations for Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/security-recommendations).
