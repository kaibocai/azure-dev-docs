### Account for authentication and authorization

Most applications have some kind of authentication and authorization. If you use LDAP for authentication, you can set up Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) with secure LDAP and configure LDAP connections in WebLogic Server. For more information, see [Create and configure an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance) and [Configure secure LDAP for an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps).
