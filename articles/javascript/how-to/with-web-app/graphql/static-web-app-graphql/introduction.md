# 1. Build and deploy a GraphQL static web app to Azure

In this article series, you'll create a GraphQL server and a web application to communicate with it. Your GraphQL server will use Azure Cosmos DB to store data, and Static Web Apps to host the application.

* [Sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/js-e2e-graphql-cosmosdb-static-web-app)

[!INCLUDE [Create or use existing Azure Subscription ](../../../../includes/environment-subscription-h2.md)]

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed to your local machine.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed to your local machine. 
    - [Static Web Apps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps) to deploy a React app to Static Web Apps.
    - [Azure Databases](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-cosmosdb) to create the database created with Azure Cosmos DB.
- [Azure Cosmos DB local emulator](/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) to use a local database created with Azure Cosmos DB. 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to push to GitHub, which activates the GitHub action.
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to fork and push to a repo.

## Application architecture

The application architecture is shown in the following diagram:

The React client constructs a GraphQL query by using a GraphQL client package (you'll be using Apollo), and calls the API to retrieve the data. Using a GraphQL server (you'll be using the Apollo server implementation), the GraphQL query is converted into resolver calls. You can use these calls to pass the information to a SQL query in Azure Cosmos DB. The SQL query is sent to Azure Cosmos DB, and returns the data requested. The GraphQL resolver returns the results in a well-formatted GraphQL data object. 

The React client and API are hosted in Static Web Apps. The data is stored in a SQL database in Azure Cosmos DB.
