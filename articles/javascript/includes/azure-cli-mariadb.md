### Create a MariaDB resource with Azure CLI

Use the following Azure CLI [az mariadb server create](/cli/azure/mariadb/server#az-mariadb-server-create) command in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to create a new MariaDB resource for your database. 

```azurecli
az mariadb server create \
    --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID-OR-NAME \
    --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP \
    --name YOURRESOURCENAME \
    --location eastus \
    --admin-user YOUR-ADMIN-NAME \
    --ssl-enforcement Disabled \
    --enable-public-network Enabled  
```

This command may take a couple of minutes to complete and creates a publicly available resource in the `eastus` region. 

The response includes your server's configuration details including: 
* the autogenerated password for the admin account
* the command to connect to the server with mysql CLI

Before you can connect to the server programmatically, you need to configure your firewall rules to allow your client IP address through. 

### Add firewall rule for your client IP address to MariaDB resource

By default, the firewall rules aren't configured. You should add your client IP address so your client connection to the server with JavaScript is successful.

```azurecli
az mariadb server firewall-rule create \
--resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP \
--server YOURRESOURCENAME \
--name AllowMyIP --start-ip-address 123.123.123.123 \
--end-ip-address 123.123.123.123
```

If you don't know your client IP address, use one of these methods:
* Use the Azure portal to view and change your firewall rules, which include adding your detected client IP
* Run your Node.js code, the error about your firewall rules violation includes your client IP address

While you can add the full range of internet addresses as a firewall rule, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255, this leaves your server open to attacks.

### Create a database on the server with Azure CLI

Use the following Azure CLI [az mariadb db create](/cli/azure/mariadb/db#az-mariadb-db-create) command in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com) to create a new MariaDB database on your server. 

```azurecli
az mariadb db create \
    --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID-OR-NAME \
    --resource-group YOUR-RESOURCE-GROUP \
    --server-name YOURRESOURCENAME \
    --name YOURDATABASENAME
```

### Get the MariaDB connection string with Azure CLI

Retrieve the MariaDB connection string for this instance with the [az mariadb server show-connection-string](/cli/azure/mariadb/server#az-mariadb-server-show-connection-string) command:

```azurecli
az mariadb server show-connection-string \
    --subscription YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID-OR-NAME \
    --server-name YOURRESOURCENAME \
    --database-name YOURDATABASENAME \
    --admin-user YOUR-ADMIN-NAME \
    --admin-password YOUR-ADMIN-PASSWORD 
```

This returns the connection strings for the popular languages as a JSON object.
